The next spring/summer the stem of the biennial plant becomes much longer. The plant then flowers, produces fruits and seeds before it finally dies.

The bubbling raises the melting point of the oil. As the hydrogen passes through, the oil begins to become solid. By stopping the hydrogenation part of the way through, manufacturers obtain 'partially hydrogenated oil'. This is similar to butter, but much cheaper to produce. It is sold as 'margarine', 'oleo' or 'vegetable shortening'.  The process allows cheaply adding a butter-like consistency to food products."

These sounds are pronounced by bringing two parts of the mouth, for example the tongue and the roof of the mouth, close to each other. However, it is not close enough to cause the air to be blocked, like in a fricative consonant. Also, the parts are not far apart enough to become a vowel."
